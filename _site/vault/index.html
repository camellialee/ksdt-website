<h2 id="la-times-students-cut-an-alternative-edge-at-ksdt-fm-radio-2171987">LA TIMES Students Cut An Alternative Edge At Ksdt-fm Radio 2/17/1987</h2>
<p>MIKE GRANBERRY
LA JOLLA — Rebecca Levin is a smart, articulate, fashionably dressed, 21-year-old college junior. People are sometimes surprised she isn’t wearing orange hair or purple dreadlocks, or Beastie Boys buttons on a velvet lapel.</p>

<p>Appearances can be deceiving, she said.</p>

<p>Levin is general manager of the UC San Diego campus radio station. That’s KSDT-FM, which has a potentially massive listening audience. You can pick it up at 95.7 on Cox Cable FM, 95.5 on Southwestern Cable FM.</p>

<p>That means even housewives and businessmen can get it. City Council members, Padre outfielders, surrealist painters and afterlife therapists can get it. Even venture capitalists can pull it in over a croissant and the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>But do they? And if they don’t, what are they missing?</p>

<p>A spokesman for Cox said a lot of people just plain miss cable FM. Out of 278,000 Cox subscribers, only 3,000 get the FM service. He, of course, would like a higher number, as would KSDT. (It costs $3.95 a month.)</p>

<p>KSDT reaches only a few dormitories, wired to receive the signal through electrical outlets–you just can’t get it over the airwaves. And that’s a shame, because KSDT is not your typical “America’s Finest City” music-and-go-get-‘em news radio station.</p>

<p>It’s different. It’s daring and alternative, at times unusual and, most of all, unconventional.</p>

<p>If typical in San Diego is sometimes seen as conservative, Republican, stodgy or even yuppieish, it’s none of those things. It’s atypical and tries oh-so-hard to stay that way.</p>

<p>Levin was asked over a cup of hard black coffee if the station ever played James Taylor or Jackson Browne.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, looking slightly confused, “we don’t do oldies.”</p>

<p>What do they do?</p>

<p>We’re talking fringe here. We’re talking waiting-to-happen-but-haven’t-yet. We’re talking–are you ready?–the Legendary Pink Dots, the Godfathers, Firehose and Blow Monkeys. We’re not even talking Beastie Boys or Dead Kennedys anymore. They got “so big” that KSDT can now take pride in having once played them before commercialism sucked them up and made them rich.</p>

<p>That’s the view, at least, of Mark Neiter, one of many well-spoken, unassuming students who populate the airwaves at KSDT or administer the garishly decorated front office. Levin estimated the station has as many as 125 to 200 students working for it at any time. Its funding from Associated Students has risen to a new high ($38,000 a year), and dream-fantasies now include an FCC license to make it a “real” station, over real airwaves, as well as plans to broaden the range on campus.</p>

<p>“Like a lot of college radio,” said Neiter, a 21-year-old junior from Los Angeles, “we’re committed to supporting bands and music that aren’t played on commercial radio. We ask ourselves, is it alternative or progressive? Does it have integrity? We play a wide variety, stuff that’s very eclectic or different, that no one else would touch, because it is so eclectic or different or new.</p>

<p>“In other words, we can go from (jazz great) Billie Holliday to (hard-rock) Husker Du just like that.”</p>

<p>Music on KSDT isn’t just “punk” or “new wave,” labels that have stomached as big a beating as West Beirut in recent years. KSDT plays reggae and jazz, rock ‘n’ roll, heavy metal and funk. It has been known to showcase such bands as REM and the Police before their commercial christenings. Heard long before “So” made him a high-achieving chart climber was Peter Gabriel’s solo work.</p>

<p>“The beauty of college radio,” Neiter said, “is being noncommercial, all-volunteer, lacking economic interference. We don’t worry about ratings, being fired, whatever. We’re independent, even while being funded by Associated Students. We have a reputation of being nonconformist, but I don’t think that’s really true. We’re just people who like music and want to try new things.”</p>

<p>Levin said XTRA-FM (91-X) is the only commercial station approaching the avant-garde approach of KSDT, and even then only in a cursory way.</p>

<p>“They call themselves the cutting edge,” she said, “but they continually play things three years old. I wouldn’t exactly call that the cutting edge.”</p>

<p>Robin Roth, a radio announcer with 91-X and a KSDT alumnus, disagreed:</p>

<p>“Certain songs we play are cutting-edge songs, and we’re the only commercial station playing them. A college station is not a commercial station, and they can’t really be compared. Sure, we play three-year-old stuff, mixed in with two-year-old and brand-new stuff. You can’t play all new music.</p>

<p>“We have a Sunday night show called ‘Listen to This,’ which has a lot of cutting-edge-type music. A lot of people say, ‘Well, you play Police and the Cars, so you’re not cutting edge,’ but we also play the Cure.</p>

<p>“Hey, I loved KSDT, I grew up there–that’s where I started. It gave me a foundation and a background. College radio is one of the most wonderful things in the world.”</p>

<p>A bit of envy might also be involved. Despite being accessible on cable FM hookups on a citywide basis, KSDT often finds itself not being listened to. On-air giveaways are sometimes met with no response.</p>

<p>Still, the students press on, with an 80% music, 20% news format and the urge, in most cases, to try “real” radio once they graduate. KSDT alumni include Leslie Peters, a newswoman with KPBS-FM in San Diego; Frank Long, with KPBS, and Karen King, now in radio in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Funding is not a problem but has been at times over its 20-year history. A budget cut was once threatened after a stormy, curse-packed interview with local Ku Klux Klan boss Tom Metzger.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the station has stayed autonomous.</p>

<p>“We have the benefit of a good student body,” Levin said, “one amenable to alternative programming. We don’t have major sports (at UCSD), math and science is a big focus, and we’re very academically oriented.”</p>

<p>She would like to clear up a misconception, though.</p>

<p>“We have the reputation, at the station, of being weird-looking,” she said. “I guess some people are turned off by, oh, I don’t know, blue mohawks. But me, I always dress like this –“in a style best described as tasteful and professional, even elegant.</p>

<p>“Mainly,” she said, “we’re just serious about radio. We love it.”</p>

<p>Though KSDT was born in the late 1960’s, the author’s involvement began in the early ‘70’s.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1972 Shaun Kroese was working at radio station, KPRI, when he was approached by someone representing KSDT. The general staff at KSDT had decided they wanted some professional guidance. The obvious place to go was the most popular contemporary radio station in town, and, as fate would have it to Mr. Kroese. Shuan was reluctant at first to get involved but curiosity got the better of him and agreed to attend a meeting at KSDT. He was impressed with the student’s enthusiasm and sincerity and quickly decided he would help them attain the professionalism they were after.</p>

<p>Up to this point, KSDT was merely a playground for a handful of students to play “radio.” The station was completely without structure or organization of any kind. The studios were no more than a few pieces of broadcast equipment housed in a quonset hut. While KSDT was moving to a specially-built portion of the new Student Center, the students decided it was a good time to bring some semblance of organization to the station and decided to seek out professional guidance.</p>

<p>Mr. Kroese, along with a few co-workers from KPRI, volunteered their assistance in what essentially was “building from the ground up.” They had engineers come out to hook up equipment, held training sessions, secured a substantial number or records from commercial stations in town, and succeeded in getting the record companies to add KSDT to their mailing lists. They also made the initial step in reaching outside the campus with a hook-up with Southwestern Cable. Things couldn’t have been better unless they could actually broadcast to San Diego, but research quickly showed that there was no frequency available. While the station was indeed taking shape, there had been designated departments. Following the ‘71/’72 school year, elections were held to elect department heads. As we shall see, this would be the beginning of a non-stop series of management fiascos…</p>

<p>In the successive two years management decided to format the radio station, including strict rules and regulations. While the staff had no misgivings about these rules, it was the first of poor relations with professional help. While they encouraged outside advice, they wanted it (in fact, demanded it) on their terms. In the case of Mr. Kroese, this was not only insulting, it was impractical for him then to donate much of his own time. All of those originally involved in getting KSDT on the right track had no interest in dealing with fickle management and decided to let the station manage for itself. Eventually, the station and its audience suffered by the lack of professional input so a majority of the staff decided they wanted its return. Shaun agreed to become involved again on a limited basis, but, again, ran into problems with their unreasonable demands. </p>

<p>In the 1974/75 school year a new management was elected. The very nature of questionable election procedures, amounting to ballot-stuffing, foreshadowed what became the station’s most damaging management. They were a power-hungry crew that set up a virtual dictatorship. In the months to come, they managed to strip KSDT of a good deal of its music library in order to set-up a commercial studio elsewhere in town. It took awhile, but the staff began to see the management for the sham that it was. So set the stage for the most rebellious period, with plenty of political implications included, in the station’s history. Relations with the Associated Students were seriously damaged during this regime. </p>

<p>When election time came around again, political lines were drawn, and extensive lobbying took place. The previous management was defeated by a landslide. It was a sort of good news/bad news story; the good news being new management dedicated to a democratic structure, and the bad news - the mess they were left to clean up. To this day, the station is indirectly “paying” for the misdeeds of one station management.</p>

<p>Under the new management, a thorough KSDT constitution was drawn with total staff input and authorship primarily by the station’s General Manager, Ralph Hawkins, with considerable help by Shaun Kroese, who had similar experience with other colleges. Relations with the A.S. and the record companies were patched up somewhat. Those with professional experience were encouraged to participate. We hooked up with Mission Cable (now “Cox”) providing coverage to approximately 50% of San Diego County. The groundwork had been laid under a very dedicated, sincere management for what would be the station’s most successful period. That rebuilding time was not without a repeat of some of the growing pains during the station’s earlier history, though: exhaustive research was done to determine the feasibility of obtaining a broadcast license; on-campus coverage was in experimentation as were various program formats.</p>

<p>By now it is 1977 and a cycle can be seen in the station’s operations. With every new “crop of students” (approximately 80% turnover every two years) came personnel unaware of the station’s past, and therefore, unable to learn from it. Everyone had his/her own idea on how to run things and every management became fickle in regards to how much professional input they would allow. </p>

<p>As mentioned, KSDT was on the verge of its most successful era (1977-1979 school years). This success can be attributed to these key factors: thorough reorganization ground work laid down by Ralph Hawkins as GM; maturation and outstanding dedication by a few individuals over a period of at least three years; and, considerable input by a few with professional experience. Though KSDT had its share of internal problems, it enjoyed a sort of renaissance period…positive feelings of accomplishment abounded. But, the cycle would soon come to an end as the folks responsible for these accomplishments moved on to something else. The students involved at the time with three of four years experience behind them, graduated, with some entering the communications field. Their replacements in management would soon alienate the professionals involved, eventually leading to their departure. Then, they (the new management) too would arrive with their own ideas, swollen egos and internal political rumblings. The past year and a half has seen the largest turnover of staff in the station’s history. They have been extremely fickle in dealing with outside advice and have isolated themselves, along with their problems (and inexperience) to such an extent that they have really dug themselves into a hole. And, of course, the Tom Metzger affair nearly sealed the coffin for KSDT.</p>
