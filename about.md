KSDT is a student-run radio station located on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. The station has existed since 1967, but has taken many different forms since then. In its current configuration, KSDT broadcasts solely via streaming MP3 on the internet. KSDT provides music and activities for the UCSD community and the greater worldwide web â€” striving to promote independent music not available from mainstream sources and work to help the San Diego Community.

In addition to producing radio shows, KSDT maintains and operates studio facilities providing practice space for undiscovered area bands. KSDT uses its contacts in the music industry to produce campus appearances by KSDT approved acts, producing live Studio Sessions for up and coming independent bands.
